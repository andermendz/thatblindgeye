<h2 align="center">My name is Eric (he/him). N-eyes to meet you! :eyeglasses:</h2>

I'm a Front-End Web Developer, focused on making apps as accessible as possible. As someone with an eye disease, having accessible features in an app can be a huge deal for me. Understanding how certain features affect others with impairments or disabilties is something I am constantly researching, so that I can improve how accessible my apps are to a wider audience.

It can be easy to overlook how certain features can affect (or even turn away) those with an impairment or disability. Something such as a dark theme option or having an outline on focused elements may seem like something simple (or not needed!) to some, but can actually be an *incredible* benefit for many. Animations, contrasts, visual focus indicators, warnings for unexpected and loud sounds... Those are just some of the things that I think we all need to take into consideration with our app designs.

The great thing I've found, and am currently developing my skills on, is that there doesn't have to be such a black and white choice when it comes to making a site accessible or keeping aesthetic features. Simply having a warning on page load, stating that your app uses animations or has unexpected sounds, and offering the choice to disable those options? Even that can be a massive improvement and is one step further in the right direction.

### Currently...

I'm expanding my skills in creating accessible-friendly apps (does this belong here or the "from now until forever" section?) and currently learning how to utilize Sass and React.

Beyond expanding my skills and knowledge, I'm a member of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I help other members (especially with accessibility features in HTML/CSS) and receive help from an incredible community, am part of a book club for You Don't Know JavaScript (1st Edition), and make contributions to the Odin Project repos.

### Future Plans...

- Delve some of the more popular CSS frameworks.
- Expand my back-end knowledge to evolve from a front-end dev to a full-stack dev.
- Work on the aesthetic side of my apps in parallel with the accessibility side.
- Continue making contributions to The Odin Project, and look for other open source contributions that I can become a part of. Know of any? Let me know!

### Outside of Coding...

When I'm not coding, I most enjoy flexing my creative muscles by playing in and running D&D campaigns. :game_die:

For the campaign that I run, I took bits and pieces of a homebrew to design my own set of homebrew rules, which proved to be a lengthy process (2+ years to get the rules in a playable state). Collaborating with friends/players to create a story together, built from the ground up by nothing but our imaginations, and having endless possibilities... I guess getting into coding was only :game_die: natural. :game_die:
