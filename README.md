<h2 style="text-align: center;">My name is Eric (he/him), n-eyes to meet you! :eyeglasses:</h1>

I'm a Front-End Web Developer, focused on the belief that any web experience should be as accessible as possible. As someone with an eye disease myself, understanding how certain features affect those with impairments or disabilties is something I am constantly researching. Something such as a dark theme option or having an outline on focused elements may seem like something simple to some, but can actually be an incredible benefit for others.

When I'm not coding, I most enjoy flexing my creative muscles by playing in and running D&D campaigns :game_die:. For the campaign that I run, I designed an entire set of homebrew rules, using bits and pieces of another homebrew, which proved to be a lengthy process (2+ years to get the rules in a playable state).

<h3>Currently...</h3>
I'm expanding my skills in creating accessible-friendly apps, and will soon be working with API's. I'm also utilizing webpack more and more to fine-tune my work process when using modules and packages.

Beyond expanding my skills, I'm a member of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), where I offer advice on accessibility features in HTML/CSS with my current knowledge and receive help from an incredible community, am part of a book club for You Don't Know JavaScript (1st Edition), and have made contributions to their site.

<h3>Future Plans?</h3>
* looking forward to delving into React, as well as trying out some of the more popular CSS frameworks.

* expand my back-end knowledge to evolve from a front-end dev to a full-stack dev. As of this moment, I've tested out Firebase's real time database minimally, and want to utilize it in an actual app at some point to get a better understanding of it.

* continue making contributions to The Odin Project, and look for other open source contributions that I can make.
