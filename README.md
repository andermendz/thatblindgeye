<p>I'm a Front-End Web Developer, focused on helping make apps as accessible as possible. As someone with an eye disease, having accessible features can be a huge deal for me. Understanding how certain features affect others with impairments or disabilties is something I am constantly researching, so that I can improve how accessible my apps are.</p>

<p>It can be easy to not think of how certain features can affect (or even turn away) those with an impairment or disability. Something such as a dark theme option or having an outline on focused elements may seem like something simple (or not needed) to some, but can actually be an incredible benefit for many. Animations, contrasts, visual focus indicators, warnings for unexpected and loud sounds... Those are just some things I think more need to take into consideration.</p>

### Outside of Coding...
<p>When I'm not coding, I most enjoy flexing my creative muscles by playing in and running D&D campaigns. :game_die:</p>

<p>For the campaign that I run, I took bits and pieces of a homebrew to design my own set of homebrew rules, which proved to be a lengthy process (2+ years to get the rules in a playable state). Collaborating with friends/players to create a story together, built from the ground up by nothing but our imaginations, and having endless possibilities... I guess getting into coding was only natural. :game_die:</p>

### Currently...

I'm expanding my skills in creating accessible-friendly apps (does this belong here or the "from now until forever" section?), and will soon be working with API's. I'm also utilizing webpack more and more to fine-tune my work process when using modules and packages.

Beyond expanding my skills, I'm a member of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I offer advice on accessibility features in HTML/CSS with my current knowledge and receive help from an incredible community, am part of a book club for You Don't Know JavaScript (1st Edition), and make contributions to the Odin Project repos.
___
### Future Plans...

- Delve into React, as well as some of the more popular CSS frameworks.
- Expand my back-end knowledge to evolve from a front-end dev to a full-stack dev. I've tested out Firebase's real time database, and want to utilize it in an actual app at some point to get a better understanding of it.
- Continue making contributions to The Odin Project, and look for other open source contributions that I can become a part of.
